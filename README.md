# ðŸŒ¿ Steward
A [pace-layered](https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/pace-layers/) approach to high-volume Discord Servers.

Stream interfaces like Discord and Slack basically create a single global timeline that moves at a certain rate. If you miss a certain conversation, it flows away.
Someone once described Slack as the online version of the open office arrangement â€“ it puts the pressure of everything being visible all the time to everybody on the individual.

How can we create [mangroves](https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/Mangrove-Theory-of-the-Internet)? Garden/forest type ecosystems which have gently flowing multi-branched stream systems, designed for digital mindfulness and non-linearity?

Steward is an attempt to give back agency to users to control the speed of information in the projects they are a part of.
